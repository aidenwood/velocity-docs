## Edit the home page and its components
Look at the files that are imported at the top of the index.astro file, and edit the component file or in some cases, slot based components, edit the text directly on the page file.
Component based editing is the same for all other pages.


```bash title="index.astro"
Component with Stripe Purchase Link
```
