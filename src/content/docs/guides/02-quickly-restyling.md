## Quickly Restyling the theme
- Quickly changing the theme for your latest client use or branding.
    - Change the primary and secondary colours.
    - Change the font file used.
    - Add any extra dependancies.
    - Install dependencies
    - Navigate to your project folder and install its dependencies:

```bash title="astro.config.mjs"
to be copied
```

Change the primary and secondary colour here to quickly restyle the theme to a brand.

## Update the Favicon Images

Simply replace the favicon.ico and favicon.png icons in the /SRC folder.
I recommend using the following website for exporting a range of png options.
