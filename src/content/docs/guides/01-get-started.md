</Card>

## Getting Started
- Requirements
    - Basic knowledge of Astro, HTML and CSS.
    - Text editor (We recommend Visual Studio Code)
    - Node.js 18 or higher.
    - Install dependencies
    - Navigate to your project folder and install its dependencies:

```bash title="Install Velocity's dependenciesâ€¦"
npm install
```
DevNote: Make Deploy with Netlify and Vercel Buttons for point and click install


npm install
Start
Once the installation is done, you can now run your app:

npm run dev
This runs the app in development mode. Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in the browser.

Build
npm run build
This builds the app for production to the ./dist/ folder.
