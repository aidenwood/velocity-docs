Velocity helps web designers and developers move faster with individual projects.

Mostly by offering a range of pre-build components and file structuring, dynamically rendering data on other pages and components, and dynamically render complete pages through Astro Props. To make the most use of Velocity as a beginner to framework / before making it your own, it is essential to follow the basic structure for quickly reusing the components.

(Most of the time this is as simple as just changing the text data in the component, page, or imported .js data file)


## E-Commerce Index Starter Template
Simple home page design, great for making use of the SnipCart or Stripe payment integrations within Velocity quickly.

```bash title="index.astro (E-Commerce home page)"
copy from immersive
```




## E-Commerce All Products Starter Template

```bash title="index.astro (All Products page)"
copy from immersive
```


## E-Commerce Single Product Starter Template
