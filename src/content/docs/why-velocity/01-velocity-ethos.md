## I built Velocity for 5 main reasons
While there are a huge range of things Velocity helps web designers and developers with, the entire time I've been improving this project, I have tried to keep it to a core ethos.


#### Manageable, perfected UX design system.
Keeping a design system consistent without the right framework and foundation is near impossible. Making the most use of dynamically rendered content and props for less manual changes.

#### Maintaining A+ page load performance.
Maintaining a high-performance website, especially once scaling a company, becomes the Jenga game from hell.

#### Avoiding the trap of no-code builders.
I've seen too many clients and business owners unable to easily scale due to being trapped with a website builder. Better AI integration with any service, complete ability to edit anything.

#### Aiming for 'absolutely everything out-of-the-box'.
Not just a starter template, not just a design system, but most things a high-performing website absolutely needs, ready to go from day one for every project you build with Velocity.
